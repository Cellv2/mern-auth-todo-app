# See it live!

Coming soon &trade;

## Goals

There are four main goals I have with this project:

1) Learn about client-server authentication

2) Become more familiar with MongoDB

3) Implement theme switching

4) Continue to practise React and TypeScript

## Installing

Please remember to run npm install in both subfolders - they are projects in their own right.

## .env

Please add a .env file at the root of the project. This must include the following variables:
| Var name      | Type   | Used for?      | Example                         |
|---------------|--------|----------------|---------------------------------|
| SECRET_OR_KEY | String | The JWT secret | SECRET_OR_KEY="GitToThaChoppuh" |

## Other bits

### Client

The client project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
